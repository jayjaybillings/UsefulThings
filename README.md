## Installing, running tests, and launching the server

It is pretty straightforward to execute the run the code. First, install it with

```bash
npm install
```

run the tests with

```bash
npm test
```

and start the server with

```bash
npm start
```

All of these can be run as a single command:

```bash
npm install && npm test && npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

If something weird happens, it is likely Stackblitz' fault. When it is Stackblitz' fault, the solution is usually updating the versions of third party development dependencies.
